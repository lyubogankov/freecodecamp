1. How does freecodecamp's website work?
    - The editor appears the be visual studio, but in the browser (same styling, same key commands)
    - How are the explanation text boxes inserted?
    - How is the cursor start-point configured per lesson?
    - How is the code tested?
    - How are is link functionality over-ridden?  They don't actually link anywhere, but cause a popup to appear
    - What does the CTRL+S "save to browser's local storage" do?
